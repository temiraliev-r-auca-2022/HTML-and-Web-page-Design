                <h3>ABOUT</h3>
                <p>My name is Rustam, I am on junior year of SFW department in AUCA. I study here because AUCA and classes here can help me to acheive my goals. I love programming related courses, but we have a lot of other interesting courses, that are not connected to programming. For example I really liked FYS and Intro to Psychology courses, so AUCA can help you to progress in more than 1 direction. </p>
